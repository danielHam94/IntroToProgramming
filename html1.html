		<h1>HTML 1</h1>
		<h2>My background</h2>
		<p>I am from Korea. I have always been interested in computers and technology. However, I haven't had a chance to learn about them in a class. I chose to take this class to learn about how technology can affect the business world. </p>
		<h2>My H101 expectations</h2>
		<p>I hope to learn and build a nice basic foundation of informatics so that I would be able to excel on the next upper level classes.</p>
