			<h1> PROBLEM STATEMENT </h1>
				<p> We were contacted to solve a serious problem within the Indiana University radio station. College students are a key audience for the station and ensuring that the DJs representing IU radio reflect the demographics of campus. We found through primary research that almost all radio hosts for IU radio come from the Media and Jacobs schools leaving most student interests under represented (Primary research). In fact, the leading reason radio stations across America are losing listeners is a lack of diversity in programming and on-air personalities (Picard). Because the demand for academically diverse demographic of DJs is so high we implemented the Radio Technology Initiative.</p>
			<h1> SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM </h1>
				<p> "The university's radio station recruits and invites new DJs and committee members every semester. They want to ensure they are reaching every demographic and group on campus. They currently recruit people via social media, word of mouth and call out meetings." </p>
			<h1> WHAT WE DID </h1>
				<p> The process that our team took to come up with the solution started with research, lots and lots of research. We first conducted a survey of students at IU and asked them questions about individuals involved in. You can find the results of our survey on the data and visualizations page.We then researched to figure out what IU Students wanted from IU Radio. You can read about the articles we found on our research page. The last step was to form a solution to this difficult problem, find it on our solutions page. </p>
