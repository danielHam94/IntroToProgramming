			<h1> Research </h1>
			<p> Our project team made thorough research (primary, secondary, and documentation) to find the best possible solution to the problem. </p>
			<p> Before we made any specific strategies to approach the problem, our group hypothesized and debated over what problems the Indiana University radio station could possibly have in targeting the right demographic. </p>
			<p> Our group conducted a survey among 30 members of IU's radio station to learn more about the current demographics and exposure. We asked questions like how they found out about radio and what majors make up the majority of the radio community. </p>
			<p> We discovered that over half the people involved in radio are primarily coming from two schools. We also determined a third of the radio population believes people aren't well-informed about radio, which leads to problems when recruiting. </p>
			<p> The graphs associated with this data can be found on our data and viz page. </p>
			<p> From this data, we found answers to where radio is advertising successfully, and where they need to improve in order to reach more groups and increases diversity. We took this data into consideration when we came up with our solution. </p>
			<p> To approach the problem towards the right solution, our group made additional research through numerous credible sources. </p>
			<p> First, we have to know if the IU radio station is using the best recruiting strategies possible. According to the RPO voice, seven best recruiting strategies come from Snapchat, Instagram, Tumblr, emails, referrals, and recruitment events. (Kolar) This article also strongly recommends that we are very clear as to the roles and responsibilities of the job we are requesting to be filled. Through this source, we were able to see that the IU radio station is currently using the strongest recruiting strategies. </p>
			<p> Most current radio stations are facing challenges. The fundamental market changes are pushing radio stations towards an uncertain future. Declining demand for radio offerings are caused by the lifestyle changes as technology evolves and more substitutes are being available. Most of these substitutes, such as MP3 players, mobile phones, and CDs allow people to create their own music playlists, giving consumers a strong benefit. With declining radio listeners, the revenue is decreasing, and costs are increasing. Worldwide radio advertising costs are about 7 percent of total expenditures, which decreased by 9 percent since 1999. The decline in radio usage indicates that we must know the demographic of current listeners and aim to recruit on that market. (Picard) </p>
			<p> To make an improvement to our radio station, our team looked at the examples of the best and successful college radio stations. According to a report by UNESCO, there are over 44,000 radio stations worldwide, and AM/FM radio listening accounts for 86% of the total time adults aged 25 to 54 spend listening to audio. ("Best Colleges") California Polytechnic, Florida State University, and Georgia Tech are some of the universities that have the best college radio stations, and what they have in common is that they track and know the demographic of their listeners. </p>
			<p> Through our primary and secondary research, our group came up with a solution to track the demographics of the current listeners of the IU radio station, find out which part of the market is not targeted, and further reach out to that demographic. Our team calls this project the Radio Technology Initiative. </p>
			<p> As we collect more and more data, we will need to manage the data. Information is a valuable asset in an organization and good data management practice is necessary to any technology based organization, as data management ought to be the most persistent discipline and activity in an organization. (Govil) According to Govil, there are about many rules in managing data effectively. Validation of data should be performed at each step in a process. The data needs to be up-to date and is time- sensitive. The management of data should also be consistent and synchronized across systems. Data should also be accurate and entered properly. </p>
			<p> Following the guidelines of this source, our group will use Microsoft Access as the primary storage of our database. With a clean and effective way of creating and managing our data, our Radio Technology Initiative project will help the IU radio station aim the right target market and recruit and increase the number of involvement of students. </p>
